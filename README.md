# WildernessWarnings
Disables options to enter the wilderness on High Risk and Target worlds.

Exceptions: trollheim agility shortcut into the wilderness, leaving the Runecrafting chaos altar, and black chin 
teleports on the max cape/hunter cape. 
Note: adding the black chin teleports would require and annoying rewrite as the max cape menu swaps plugin has changed
since this plugin was created. As a workaround, you can add "black chin*,*" to you custom menu swaps -> hides section,
although this will disable the option on all worlds. Similarly, you can lock the dialogue option with the Dialogue assistant 
plugin.
